# 🚀 **Hey, I'm Nabin Bikram Thapa!**

### **Frontend Developer (in progress) • UI/UX Designer • Young Innovator • Vibe Coder**

I’m a **16-year-old developer & designer from Nepal** who loves creating meaningful digital experiences.  
I design clean interfaces, develop interactive front-end apps, and create social media posts for my college’s **NSS Club**, where I work as a **social media designer**.

I love **vibe coding** — building in a creative flow-state, experimenting, and turning ideas into real products.

I believe in **learning by building** — every day, I aim to improve just 1% more than yesterday.
